   derive bad from the initial clauses [clauses].
   It is sound, that is, if it returns a clause, then bad is derivable
   from this clause.
   It restores the previous clauses after the call, so that
   calls to [resolve_hyp] or [query_goal_std] can still be made
   on the initial clauses passed to [corresp_initialize] after calling
   [sound_bad_derivable].

(* [bad_derivable horn_state] determines whether [bad] is derivable
