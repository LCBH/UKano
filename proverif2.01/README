Protocol verifier, copyright INRIA-CNRS, by Bruno Blanchet,
Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre 2000-2020.

This software can be used to prove secrecy and authenticity properties
of cryptographic protocols.

INSTALL

To run this software, you need Objective Caml version 4.03 or
higher. Objective Caml can be downloaded from
	http://caml.inria.fr

The installation of graphviz is required if you want to have a drawing
of graphs representing attacks that ProVerif found. It can be downloaded from
	http://graphviz.org

The installation GTK+2.24 and LablGTK2 is required if you want to
run the interactive simulator proverif_interact. Use the package manager
of your distribution to install GTK+2 and download lablgtk-2.18.6.tar.gz
from
	http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/
and follow the installation instructions in their README file.

Furthermore, on Mac OS X, you need to install XCode if you do not
already have it. It can be downloaded from
	https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

* under Unix / Mac

Uncompress the source and documentation archives using tar:

	gunzip proverif2.01.tar.gz
	tar -xf proverif2.01.tar
	gunzip proverifdoc2.01.tar.gz
	tar -xf proverifdoc2.01.tar

or if you have GNU tar:

	tar -xzf proverif2.01.tar.gz
	tar -xzf proverifdoc2.01.tar.gz

This will create a directory named proverif2.01 in the current directory.
Go into this directory, and build the programs:

	cd proverif2.01
	./build

* under Windows 

Uncompress the archives proverif2.01.tar.gz and proverifdoc2.01.tar.gz
using Winzip, in the directory of your choice. This will create a
subdirectory named proverif2.01. Open a DOS window, cd into the
proverif2.01 directory and run the build .BAT file:

	build

The system can run under Windows, but it is not very Windows-friendly:
you have to use the command line to run the programs. Improving the interface
is on the to-do list...

USAGE

This software contains three executable programs, proverif, proveriftotex,
and proverif_interact. 

The program proverif takes as input a description of a cryptographic
protocol, and checks whether it satisfies secrecy, authenticity, or
equivalence properties. The description of the protocol can have
several different formats.  The recommended format is the typed pi
calculus format, which is a dialect of the applied pi calculus (Abadi
and Fournet, POPL'01).  The description of the protocol is first
translated into Horn clauses, then the core of the verifier is called.
This input format is documented in the file docs/manual.pdf
(found in proverifdoc2.01.tar.gz). Examples of protocol descriptions 
can be found in the examples/pitype subdirectory. 
To run these examples, use 
        ./proverif <filename>.pv
or if your filename does not end in .pv,
        ./proverif -in pitype <filename>
For example:
	./proverif examples/pitype/secr-auth/NeedhamSchroederPK.pv

Other input formats are documented in the file docs/manual-untyped.pv
Research papers can be downloaded at
	http://prosecco.inria.fr/personal/bblanche/publications/index.html
They are not included in the distribution because of copyright differences.
(You cannot redistribute these papers.)

The program proveriftotex takes as input a protocol description
and converts it into a LaTeX file. This is useful for including
protocols in research papers.

The program proverif_interact is an interactive simulator for ProVerif
scripts.

The scripts "test" and "test-type" runs several tests (Unix or cygwin only):
You can run them by
         ./test all
         ./test-type all
The output of these scripts is written in the directory tests. The
filename of the output contains the argument of "test" and the
date/time of the run.
