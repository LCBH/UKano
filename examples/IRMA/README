For better readability in irma_abcdh.ORIG, we used the shortcut 'b' for 'bitstring'.
It suffices to launch the script './replace.sh irma_abcdh.ORIG  > irma_abcdh_clean.pi'
to produce the final file that can be fed to UKano.

In irma_abcdh.ORIG, we specified idealizations of outputted messages. This has been
written roughly by following the semantical canonical idealization operator.
Note that we had to slightly modified the generated files to prove both conditions
due to termination issue.
