(* The code for A or B talking to other participants can be considered
as part of the adversary, since it does not share secrets with the
code for A or B talking to A or B. (The only secret is the password.)

The code for A talking to A (and for B talking to B) could also be
separated from the rest, since it does not share secrets with the code
for A talking to B and for B talking to A.

Here, I made the choice that A and B use the same password when A
talks to B and when B talks to A. It would be easy to write the other
option in which they use a different password in each direction. *)
