Corrections of Gordon, Jeffrey CSFW'01

A -> B : A
B -> A : N (fresh)
A -> B : { m3, B, N }_kAS
B -> S : A,B,{ m3, B, N }_kAS
S -> B : { m5, A, N }_kBS
B: verify { m5, A, N }_kBS = the message from S

Correct.

Full agreement is wrong because the adversary can make B see something
different from { m3, B, N }_kAS (even though the server and A correctly see it)
so this is no real attack.
