(* [build_history recheck clause] builds a derivation for the clause
   [clause] using the history stored in that clause.
   When the depth or number of hypotheses of clauses is bounded,
   it may in fact return a derivation for an instance of [clause].
   In this case, it uses [recheck] to verify that the obtained
   clause still contradicts the desired security property.
   Raises [Not_found] in case of failure *)
val build_history : recheck_t -> reduction -> fact_tree

(* [unify_derivation next_f recheck tree] implements a heuristic 
   to find traces more often, especially with complex protocols:
   it unifies rules of the derivation [tree] when possible.
   It calls [next_f] with the obtained derivation.
   Note that success is not guaranteed; however, when the heuristic fails,
   the derivation does not correspond to a trace. 

This heuristic can break inequality constraints.
We recheck them after modifying the derivation tree.
We also recheck that the derivation still contradicts the security 
property after unification, using the function [recheck].

When the heuristic fails or these checks fail, we still try to reconstruct
a trace from the original derivation, by calling [next_f tree]. *)
