val glob_table : (string, funsymb) Hashtbl.t

(* [copy_process add_in_glob_table p] returns a copy of the process [p]
   * If [add_in_glob_table] is true, it renames each name created by
   a restriction to a fresh name, and adds these names to [glob_table].
   * It renames all bound variables to fresh distinct variables.
   When [add_in_glob_table] is true, these variables receive distinct
   numbers, so that they have distinct names when they are displayed.
   * New occurrences are created for each program point in the process.
   * Free variables of [p] may be linked to terms via [TLink t] on entry.
   In this case, these variables are substituted by the terms in question
   during the copy. Notice that variables that occur as arguments of
   restrictions [Restr] can only be linked to variables via
   [TLink (Var b)], not to other terms. *)
val copy_process : bool -> process -> process

(* [prepare_process p] returns a copy of the process [p], such that:
   * each name created by a restriction is renamed to a fresh name
   (these names are in [glob_table]);
   * all bound variables are renamed to fresh distinct variables,
   with distinct numbers;
   * new occurrences are created at each program point in the process,
   starting from 1. *)

(* [reset_occurrence p] creates a fresh copy of the process [p]
   with occurrences nicely numbered.
   Names and variables are fresh copies but keep their old name *)
val reset_occurrence : process -> process

(* [simplify_process p next_f] simplifies the process [p]
   by merging branches as much as possible, and calls [next_f p']
   for each obtained simplified process. *)
val simplify_process : process -> (process -> unit) -> unit

(* [verify_process l p] verifies that all free variables of 
   [p] are in the list [l]. 
   In particular, [verify_process [] p] verifies that
   the process [p] is closed. *)
val verify_process : binder list -> process -> unit

(* [obtain_biprocess_from_processes p1 p2 next_f] tries to merge
   the two processes [p1] and [p2] into a biprocess [p] and calls
   [next_f p] for each obtained biprocess [p]. *)
