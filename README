This is a modified version of the ProVerif tool including automatic
verification of anonymity and unlinkability of 2-agents protocols.
The file README_PV contains the README file of ProVerif.


INSTALL

See the file README_PV.


EXAMPLES

To quickly test the tool: build it, go to src/examples/ and use the
script AutoCheck.sh on our case studies (there is a subfolder for each).

USAGE

You must use the executable program proverif.
To run UKANO on a ProVerif file <filename> (see next for the expected
format of this file), use 
        ./proverif -ukano <filename>

The folder './examples/' contain some ProVerif files in the expected
format. It can be used as a starting point to write your own
protocols.

Only typed ProVerif files are accepted (the option '-in pitype' is
enabled by default). The file should not define new types and only use
the type 'bitstring'. The equational theory must declare a constant
'hole' by adding this line: 'free hole:bitstring;'. After the
definition of the equational theory (without any declaration of
events), the inputted file should contain a commentary:
       (* ==PROTOCOL== *)
and then define only one process corresponding to the whole multiple
sessions system. This process should satisfy the syntactical
restrictions described in [1]. However, multiple tests (conditional or
evaluation) can be performed in a row between an input and an output
if the corresponding 'else' branches are the same. Each output message
should be of the form: 'choice[u,uh]' where 'u' is the real message
outputted by the protocol and 'uh' is the idealization of any concrete
message outputted here (by using the constant 'hole' incstead of
holes). This will be used to check the first condition (outputs are
without relation). Finally, to check anonymity as well, identity names
to be revealed (and only them) must have 'id-' as prefix (e.g., 
id-name). See the folder 'examples/' for see some examples of such
files.
